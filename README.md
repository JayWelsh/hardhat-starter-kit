# Hardhat Starter Kit

This project includes some additional [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) plugins and project structuring which isn't included in the project generated by the standard `npx hardhat`, in order to save time when starting a new Solidity codebase which is likely to end up benefitting from these additional plugins.

In order for this codebase to operate, rename `.env.example` to `.env` and filling in the environment variables (never commit your `.env` file to your repository, the `.env` file will be ignored by default by `.gitignore`).

The following additional [Hardhat plugins](https://hardhat.org/plugins) are included with this project:

## @nomiclabs/hardhat-etherscan [Official Plugin]

This official [plugin](https://github.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat/tree/master/packages/hardhat-etherscan) made by [Nomic Foundation](https://nomic.foundation/), developers behind Hardhat, is used to make it easier to verify your contracts within your Hardhat project on Etherscan. This plugin makes use of the `ETHERSCAN_API_KEY` in the `.env` file (see `.env.example`).

An example of usage of this functionality is shown in [scripts/sample-deployment.js](https://github.com/JayWelsh/hardhat-starter-kit/blob/main/scripts/sample-deployment.js#L33-L54).

## hardhat-gas-reporter [Community Plugin]

This community [plugin](https://github.com/cgewecke/eth-gas-reporter) made by [Christopher Gewecke](https://github.com/sc-forks/solidity-coverage) via is used to make it easier to keep track of the gas usage of your Solidity code. Upon running tests, this plugin will automatically output gas-usage statistics based off the different method calls and deployments completed by your tests (runs by default during `npx hardhat test`).

## hardhat-contract-sizer [Community Plugin]

This community [plugin](https://github.com/ItsNickBarry/hardhat-contract-sizer) made by [Nick Barry](https://github.com/ItsNickBarry) is used to make it easier to keep track of the different sizes of your contracts, this helps to make sure that no contracts exceed the 24.576 kg limit imposed by [EIP-170](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-170) in Ethereum's (Spurious Dragon)[https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-607] hard fork. It also improves the experience of making different optimizations to your Solidity code in order to decrease deployment costs (e.g. seeing the impact of using shorter revert messages). Runs by default upon running `npx hardhat test`.

## solidity-coverage [Community Plugin]

This community [plugin](https://github.com/sc-forks/solidity-coverage), also made by [Christopher Gewecke](https://github.com/cgewecke), via [sc-forks](https://github.com/sc-forks), is used to make it easier to keep track of which parts of your Solidity codebase have been covered by your test cases as well as which parts have not been covered.

In order to generate a coverage report, run `npx hardhat coverage`, the .gitignore folder will ignore the coverage files so if you would like to commit them to your repo, adjust the `.gitignore` accordingly.

## dotenv

This common Javascript [module](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv) made by [Mot](https://github.com/motdotla) is used to load environment variables from `.env` files into the runtime of your codebase (in this case we use the `.env` to populate environment data in our `hardhat.config.js` file, this also makes it easier for code secrets to be kept in one place and to avoid committing secrets to the codebase repo by virtue of `.env` being ignored in `.gitignore`).
